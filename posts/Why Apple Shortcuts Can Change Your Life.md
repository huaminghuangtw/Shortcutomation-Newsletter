We all have that moment—phone in hand, swiping through apps, doing the same tasks again and again. Opening a journaling app. Setting a timer. Texting the same message every morning. It's repetitive. It's distracting.

But what if your phone could just do it for you?

Welcome to the world of Apple Shortcuts—your first step into a calmer, more intentional digital life.

🍎 So, What Is an Apple Shortcut?

Think of a shortcut as a custom mini-app that lives on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

It takes a task—or a whole sequence of tasks—and turns them into one tap or one Siri command.

Want to log your mood every night? One tap.

Want to send a “Good Morning” text and start your favorite playlist? One tap.

Want to open your reading app, turn on Focus Mode, and dim your lights? One. Tap.

Apple Shortcuts give you the power to automate what you repeat, so your energy goes where it matters.

🧠 Why Shortcuts Matter (And Why I Started This Site)

We live in a world that's always-on, always-tapping, always-scrolling. I don't want my phone to run my day—I want it to support it.

That's the philosophy behind Shortcutomation:

Using automation not just for efficiency, but for intention.

Less friction. More flow.

I created this site to help people like you:

	-	Simplify your tech routines

	-	Save time on daily habits

	-	Build workflows that reflect your values, not just your calendar

This is about designing a digital lifestyle that works for you—not the other way around.

🛠️ 3 Simple Shortcuts You Can Use Today

Here are three beginner-friendly shortcuts that anyone can try—even if you've never used the Shortcuts app before.

1. 📓 One-Tap Journal Entry

Open Notes and prompt yourself to reflect on your day.

→ Download the Shortcut

Bonus tip: You can customize the journal question to match your own self-reflection practice.

1. 🎧 Start Your Focus Mode

Launch your focus playlist, open your study/work app, and silence distractions.

→ Download the Shortcut

Use this as a ritual: one tap = “I'm ready to work.”

1. 💬 “I'm On My Way” Text

Send a preset message (like “Leaving now!” or “Home in 10 🚗”) to someone you text often.

→ Download the Shortcut

It saves time, but more importantly—it saves thought.

👣 What's Next for You (and Shortcutomation)

This is just the beginning.

Over the coming weeks, I'll share:

	-	Advanced workflows (that feel like magic)

	-	Life-centered tech rituals

	-	Tips on creating your own shortcuts, even if you're not a developer

I believe tech should amplify your intention, not drain your attention.
