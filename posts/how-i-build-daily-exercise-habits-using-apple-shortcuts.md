We all know we _should_ exercise more. But usually, the barrier to entry is just too high. We think we need to change into gym clothes, drive somewhere, or carve out an entire hour.

But what if the goal wasn’t a “workout”? What if the goal was just **one minute**?

I used to struggle with consistency until I automated my fitness using a simple Apple Shortcut.

Here is how I used technology to lower the bar and build a daily habit that actually sticks.

# The Science of “Exercise Snacking”

First, let’s talk about the data source. I rely on content from **[Darebee](https://darebee.com)**, a non-profit organization that provides free, accessible workouts.

They specialize in “Exercise of the Day” challenges—single movements you can do anywhere, without any equipment.

Is one minute really enough? Science says yes.

A [2022 review](https://doi.org/10.1249/JES.0000000000000275) highlights that performing short, intense bursts of vigorous exercise (≤1 min) throughout the day is a feasible and time-efficient way to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and offset the negative effects of sedentary behavior.

This is called **“[Exercise Snacking](https://www.google.com/search?q=Exercise+Snacking).”**

By shrinking the commitment to 60 seconds, you aren’t “going to the gym”; you’re just doing 20 squats while your coffee brews.

# The “Atomic” Approach

The science proves it works for your _body_, but how do you make it work for your _brain_?

In the book _[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)_, James Clear argues that the biggest barrier to a new habit isn’t ability—it’s **friction**.

He introduces “[The Law of Least Effort](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11868388-human-behavior-follows-the-law-of-least-effort-we-will),” which states that human behavior naturally gravitates toward the option that requires the least amount of work.

* **High Friction:** Packing a gym bag + driving 15 mins + changing clothes.
* **Zero Friction:** Tapping a notification on the phone you are already holding.

> _“My number one priority in life, above my happiness, above my family, above my work, is my own health. It starts with my physical health. Because my physical health became my number one priority, then I could never say I don’t have time. […] I do not start my day until I’ve worked out. I don’t care if the world is imploding and melting down, it can wait another 30 minutes until I’m done working out.” — Naval Ravikant_

For years, I fell into the “all or nothing” trap. If I couldn’t do a full long workout session, I would do nothing at all.

The problem wasn’t a lack of discipline; it was a decision problem. I needed the exercise to come to _me_.

Now, I [exercise daily](https://www.strava.com/athletes/huaminghuang) because I’ve automated the decision-making process. I don’t have to choose a workout, and I don’t have to remember to do it at all.

# The Setup

1. I configured a Personal Automation in the Shortcuts app to trigger my custom “[Exercise Of The Day](https://shortcutomation.com/gallery/shared/exercise-of-the-day/)” shortcut daily at 1:00 PM—the specific time I [hit my post-lunch slump](https://huami.ng/2025/07/30/a-midday-routine-i-do-every-day/) and need to wake my body up.

2. Each day at 1:00 PM sharp, my phone buzzes. I don’t even have to unlock it. The notification appears right on my Lock Screen, telling me exactly what the “snack” is. [^1]

3. Here is the most important part. I don’t need to open a browser or an app. **I simply long-press the notification.** Upon expansion, the notification presents a GIF of the exercise with the target rep count, making the full workout immediately accessible

By combining the biological benefit of “Exercise Snacking” with the psychological hack of “Lowering the Bar,” I removed the chance of saying “no” to myself.

This setup works because it respects my laziness. On days when I have zero energy, I can still do 20 squats.

As [James Clear says,](https://x.com/JamesClear/status/1054799443768287232) “A habit must be established before it can be improved. Start small. Master the art of showing up. Optimize later.”

If you are struggling to build a fitness habit, stop trying to climb a mountain.

Just start with a notification and one minute of your time.
