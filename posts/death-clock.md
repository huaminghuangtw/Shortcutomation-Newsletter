> _“Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.” — Steve Jobs_

Death is scary. It's uncomfortable to think about—so we tend to avoid it. But when we use death not as something to fear, but as a **frame of reference**, it becomes a powerful tool for clarity.

Ancient wisdom always teaches us life principles and philosophies. They stood the test of time for a reason. I like the Stoic “live as if today were your last” mindset and Memento Mori, a Latin phrase that translates to “remember that you must die.”

Death is the ultimate equalizer. We may look different, live in different places, and hold different beliefs. Ultimately, we are all the same—_we are all going to die._ Death is the destination we all share, no one has ever escaped it.

This universal truth inspired me to build a **Death Clock**. It calculates the following two metrics:

1. how old I am.
2. what percentage of my life is (probably) behind me.

I also have this run as a Personal Automation, so that it brings mortality into my Lock Screen every day.

It's not the number that is the most important, but seeing the number changing day after day that makes the difference. It internalizes the certainty of death, helping me **reverse-engineer** what matters most _this moment, [this pixel](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html), this now_.

> _“Almost everything…just fall[s] away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important…Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking: you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.” — Steve Jobs_

Paradoxically, it's only when death waits at the end of the road that the unique meaning of each person's life can fully emerge. When you embrace the inescapability of death, you know you have nothing to lose and stop worrying what other people think about you. Life becomes less about proving yourself and more about giving away your gift to something greater than you. You view life as a service.

Mitch Albom once said in _Tuesdays With Morrie_:

> _“The truth is, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.”_

I believe that _learning how to die_ means being prepared for it—knowing that it's inevitably coming. Once you accept that death is _[not the opposite of it, but rather an essential part of it](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/83202-death-is-not-the-opposite-of-life-but-a-part)_, you begin to appreciate the little small things in your daily life and take in whatever comes your way.

So, #todo live each day as it were your last, because someday you'll certainly be right. Don't be a “Living Dead.” Never _die_ before you are _dead_. [One day, your life will flash before your eyes.
