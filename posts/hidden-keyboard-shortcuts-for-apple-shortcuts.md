When I first started making shortcuts, [I spent hours staring at my iPhone screen](https://huami.ng/2025/6/5/a-nighttime-routine-i-do-every-day).

Then I realized I could build Shortcuts on my MacBook too. I started _dragging actions_, _typing names_, and _using keyboard shortcuts_. This made the development process smoother and faster.

Now, I use my MacBook to [create shortcuts](https://github.com/huaminghuangtw/Shortcutomation/releases) and only use my iPhone for testing and fixing bugs.

Here are some Mac keyboard shortcuts for Apple Shortcuts. I didn’t find them in any guide. I discovered them by trying things out and making mistakes.

| Keyboard Shortcut        | Description                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `Cmd + ↑/↓`       | Move action up/down               |
| `Cmd + D`         | Duplicate a shortcut              |
| `Cmd + Backspace` | Delete a shortcut                 |
| `Cmd + N`         | Create new Shortcut               |
| `Cmd + R`         | Run a Shortcut                    |
| `Cmd + Shift + A` | Add action: “Ask for Input”       |
| `Cmd + Shift + C` | Add action: “Comment”             |
| `Cmd + Shift + I` | Add action: “If-Otherwise-End If” |
| `Cmd + Shift + R` | Add action: “Repeat”              |
| `Cmd + Shift + S` | Add action: “Show Result”         |

[Keyboard shortcuts](https://huami.ng/keyboard-hotkey/) are a small investment with huge returns. The more you use them, the more time you save. At first, you might have to look them up all the time. But you can get better through practices. Mastering keyboard shortcuts has meant less context switching and more focus for me.

**If you know other shortcuts, please share with me. I will add them to the table.**
