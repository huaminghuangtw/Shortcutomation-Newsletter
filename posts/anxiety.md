# The Overview Effect in Your Pocket: How a Simple Shortcut Helps Me Combat Anxiety

For a long time, my internal monologue was a harsh taskmaster.

I lived life as a chronic overachiever. I was obsessed with productivity, efficiency, and squeezing value out of every single second. If I wasn’t “shipping,” I wasn’t worthy. This mindset spiraled into severe anxiety and a loop of negative self-talk. I was constantly zoomed in on the microscopic details of my day—the unanswered email, the imperfect code, the slightly missed deadline.

I was stuck.

I realized that to heal, I didn’t need to speed up. I need to do the exact opposite. I need to slow down.

## The Trap of Tunnel Vision

Psychologists describe the “Tunnel Effect” (or tunnel vision) as a narrowing of attention caused by high stress or anxiety. When we are in survival mode, our brain blocks out peripheral information to focus entirely on the “threat” right in front of us.

For me, the “threat” was usually just a to-do list. But because of the tunnel effect, I lost all context. I couldn’t see the big picture; I could only see the immediate problem.

# The Power of Zooming Out

When we are anxious, we react impulsively to immediate stressors.

By slowing down and creating “psychological distance” from our problems, we regain the ability to weigh the macro situation.

Naval Ravikant [once said](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K1IG_aMmi2k):

> _“I do believe that 99% of effort in life is ‘wasted’. If you look back at all the term papers you wrote, all the classes you took, all the people you dated, and all the things you stressed about. 99% of them didn’t matter; they were inconsequential; and there were a few 1% decisions that did matter.”_

When you are in the trenches of anxiety, everything feels like a life-or-death decision. But when you zoom out, you realize that most things make no difference.

We need to shift from the first-person view (the player on the field getting tackled) to the third-person view (the spectator in the stands seeing the whole game).

When in doubt, zoom out.

# The Overview Effect

There is no greater example of “zooming out” than what astronauts call **[The Overview Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect)**.

When astronauts see Earth from space, they experience a cognitive shift. They see a fragile blue marble floating in the void. National borders vanish, and individual conflicts seem comically small.

^briefly introduce Carl Sagan

As [Carl Sagan](https://www.google.com/search?q=Carl+Sagan) famously said in his _[Pale Blue Dot](https://youtu.be/wupToqz1e2g)_ reflection, our planet is just a “mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.”

If you think you have it tough, look at the Earth from 100,000 miles away. Suddenly, that stressful situation doesn’t seem so significant.

# Capturing Perspective with a Shortcut

I wanted a way to trigger this “Overview Effect” digitally—a pattern interrupt on the very device that usually causes my stress.

So, I built an [Apple Shortcut](https://shortcutomation.com/nasa-epic-gif/).

It connects to the **NASA EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) API**. This API provides daily imagery collected by the DSCOVR satellite, positioned at the Lagrange point 1 million miles from Earth.

The Shortcut fetches the latest images, stitches them together, and generates an animated GIF of our beautiful planet.

I also programmed a message to accompany it, as the notification reads:

> “你很棒，放輕鬆，別太逼自己了。”
>
> _You are enough. Relax. Don’t push yourself too hard._

With [Personal Automation](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/intro-to-personal-automation-apd690170742/ios), every night before bed, the shortcut presents me with the ultimate bird’s-eye view: The entire Earth, spinning silently in the dark. It is a visual anchor that reminds me to step back, breathe, and realize that 99% of what I’m worrying about is inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.

It helps me move from a mindset of scarcity and panic to one of perspective and peace.

I hope this tool helps you find your own “Overview Effect” right here on the ground.
